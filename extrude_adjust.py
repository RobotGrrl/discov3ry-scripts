# *experimental* gcode post-processor v2 
# for use with the Discov3ry on an Ultimaker 2+ Go!
#
# adds in commands to the original gcode to reset 
# the extruded distance. then adjusts the extruded
# distance to be a certain percentage of the original;
# if it is after a threshold of total distance
# extruded.
#
# essentially toggling back and forth between actual
# flow rate, and a reduced flow rate.
#
# the idea is for there to not be as much pressure
# building up in the system. by setting a low number
# of steps/mm, it serves as a way to let the existing
# material flow out â€”  rather than adding to the 
# built up pressure by a constant application of 
# steps/mm
#
# this is experimental, make sure you check out the
# generated gcode and see that it will not hurt
# your printer. not responsible if there is an
# icing explosion caused by this code (or anything
# else bad). 
# 
# the parameters will depend on the material you
# use - it might take a few test prints to get it
# just right
